# mock-list
Lightweight List class created using arrays

Created as homework for my Java class. It is a simple abstraction of a "list" created using the array functions. You're able to seamlessly insert strings into the list at a certain position without overlapping any existing data. It allows you to get a position of a given string, or find what string is at a certain position. It also automatically adds length to the list, so you don't accidentally run out of bounds.
